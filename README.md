# shitty-haskell

This is just me, trying to learn a little Haskell.



# install with stack
`git clone https://github.com/infoprol/shitty-haskell.git`
`cd shitty-haskell`
`stack setup`
`stack build`
`stack ghci`

[stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/GUIDE/) docs are pretty good, RTFM with joy!
